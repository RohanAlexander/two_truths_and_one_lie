# Two truths and one lie

## Overview

This repo provides analysis of an experiment designed to see if there is any relationship between the certainty of a guess, and whether it was right. 

## Obtaining raw data

The data need to be downloaded from the Google Sheet that collects the responses. This is done manually and then moved to `data/raw_data/`.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from a survey.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
